Gender Classification Model using Various machine learning models : Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree, Random Forest model, SVM classifier, KNN classification model.
Data preprocessing done using various preprocessing techniques and then applied various ML models as mentioned to generate results and in the end i have compared the performance of all models.
This project serves as great source to learn the implementation of various ML models.
